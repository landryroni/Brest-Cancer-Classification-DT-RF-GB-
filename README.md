This sample project is About Brest cancer classification using Machine Learning Trees-Algorithm such as Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting

This tutorial takes a practical and coding-focused approach. We'll learn how to use decision trees, random forests and gradient boosting to solve a real-world problem from Kaggle:

The Brest cancer Wiscosin(diagnostic) dataset is made of contains Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant where Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image:

The main work here is to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

Here following topics are covered in this tutorial:

- Downloading a real-world dataset
- Preparing a dataset for training
- Training and interpreting decision trees
- Training and interpreting random forests
- Training and interpreting gradient boosting
- option(Overfitting, hyperparameter tuning & regularization)
